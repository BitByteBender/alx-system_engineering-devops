# Secured and monitored web infrastructure (design):

# Server 1:
-> Web server (Nginx): handles incoming HTTP reqs, serves ws content.
-> App server: runs base code(website code).
-> Database (MySQL #Primary): Stores wsebsite data.

# Server 2:
-> Load Balancer SSL Termination): forwards traffic to active servers.

# Server 3:
-> Database (MySQL Replica): Stays ready to take over if the main db fails.

# Benefits:
-> Active-Active: S1 and S2 are active, while s3 is on standby(serves as a backup).
-> Passive Backup (S3): Acts as a backup for main db.

# Issues:
-> SSL Termination at load balancer: Eventhough it is efficient, it exposes decrypted traffic internally.
-> Single MySQLServer for Writes: Risk of failure, partially mitigated by Server3.
-> Uniform Server Components: Increases vulnerability to widesoread attacks.
